Homework 6

This is my submission for Homework 6.

My code is built using build.sh.

This script will build several executables, located in ./build:
   - xhw6_p1            (Problem 1)

Use the following commands to build and run the code:

chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
./build/xhw6_p1 <max_problem_size>

The codes above write their results to ./artifacts.

The files associated with each problem are as follows:

Problem 1
---------
./src/p1.cpp
./scripts/p1.slurm
./plots/p1.png

Problem 2

Problem 3

Problem 4
