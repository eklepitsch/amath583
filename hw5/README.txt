Homework 5

This is my submission for Homework 5.

My code is built using build.sh.  Note: requires OpenBLAS to be installed
(uses `-lopenblas` when compiling).

This script will build several executables, located in ./build:
   - xhw5_p3               (Problem 3)

Use the following commands to build and run the code:

chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
./build/xhw5_p3

The codes above write their results to ./artifacts.

The files associated with each problem are as follows:

Problem 3

./src/p3.cpp
./plots/p3-log-scale.png
./plots/p3-normal-scale.png
