Exam 2

This is my submission for Exam 2.

My code can be built using the script build.sh.  Executables are generated
in the ./build directory.

This script will build two executables:
   - xexam2_p1     (Problem 1)
   - xexam2_p3     (Problem 3)

In summary, run the following commands to build and run the code:

chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
./build/xexam2_p1
./build/xexam2_p3 <path_to_input_file>

The files associated with each problem are as follows:

Problem 1
---------
./src/mysparse.hpp
./src/mysparse.cpp

Problem 2
---------
evanklep_exam2.pdf (handwritten solution)

Problem 3
---------
./src/match_pattern.hpp
./src/match_pattern.cpp
./p3-results.txt

Problem 4
---------
evanklep_exam2.pdf (handwritten solution)
